// entity: data-structure| scenario: read-only ...| expected: true| result: array
// abstract data type (ADT) is array
// computers works with different types of data: how we store, organize, and group these data matters
// there's also need to know syntax for communicating with computer

// array data stored together in same sequence in memory

// need to focus on not just implementation of data structure but also performance

// linked list consists of nodes, always searches starting from the head node, and allocates memory dynamically
// nodes are objects containing storage data and memory address of next node

// starting bit is variable memory address
// variables are allocated memory block for storage
